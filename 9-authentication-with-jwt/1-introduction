JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact token format used to transmit information securely between parties. It consists of three parts:

Header: Describes how the JWT is encoded and the signature algorithm used.

Payload: Contains the claims or information to be shared.

Signature: Ensures the JWT hasn't been tampered with.

How JWT Works:

User sends credentials to the server.

Server generates a JWT and sends it back to the user.

User stores the JWT (commonly in HTTP-only cookies).

User includes JWT in requests for protected resources.

Server verifies JWT and processes the request if valid.

Key Points:

JWTs are not encrypted by default; they are encoded. To protect sensitive information, use HTTPS for transmission or encrypt the JWT.

HTTP-only cookies are preferred for storing JWTs due to their protection against XSS attacks.

Local Storage is less secure and susceptible to XSS.

Server-side storage is an option for additional security.
