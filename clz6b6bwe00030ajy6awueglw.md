### Introduction

Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.

### Steps to create an application load balancer

1. Open the **AWS Management Console** and navigate to the **EC2 dashboard**.
    
2. Create an instance and host a website, you can use an [**EC2 instance with Windows**](https://arishahmad.hashnode.dev/hosting-your-website-on-amazon-ec2-with-windows-a-complete-guide) or an [**EC2 instance with Linux**](https://arishahmad.hashnode.dev/hosting-your-website-launching-aws-ec2-instance-with-linux).
    
    **NOTE:** While launching the instance, increase the number of instances to the desired amount.
